This is my version of [Everforest](https://github.com/sainnhe/everforest) theme for [Micro](https://github.com/zyedidia/micro) terminal-based text editor. It's somewhere between Medium and Hard with few tweaks to suit my needs and my choice of languages (Python, R, LaTeX, Markdown).

I use it with [Everforest Tilix theme](https://github.com/spacefall/everforest-tilix) and [Commit Mono](https://github.com/eigilnikolajsen/commit-mono) font.
